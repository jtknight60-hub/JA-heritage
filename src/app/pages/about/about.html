  <h1>About JA Heritage</h1>
  <p>
    JA Heritage was founded to bring the authentic flavors and crafts of Jamaica to a wider
    audience. We work directly with small producers — farmers, roasters, and artisans — to source
    high-quality products that reflect Jamaica's rich culinary and cultural traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to create sustainable, fair partnerships that benefit local communities while
    offering customers transparent, traceable goods. From Blue Mountain coffee to handwoven baskets,
    every product is selected for quality and provenance.
  </p>
  <p>
    We value sustainability, fair pay, and strong relationships with our producers. If you'd like to
    learn more about our sourcing or to partner with us, please reach out via the Contact page.
